    <p><strong>Refund Policy:</strong></p>
    <p>Fee once paid will not be refunded except when you paid the fee but could not attend any of the classes. However
        the request for refund should happen before we commence the classes (at least 2 days in advance). In the above
        case, we will retain the registration fee and refund the remaining amount (if any).</p>
